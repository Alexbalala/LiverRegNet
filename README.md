Accurate Liver Registration of 3D Ultrasound and CT Volume: An Open Dataset and a Model Fusion Method
This repository contains the code and dataset for the paper "Accurate Liver Registration of 3D Ultrasound and CT Volume: An Open Dataset and a Model Fusion Method".

Overview
Liver registration between ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) is critical for various medical applications, such as surgical navigation and interventional guidance. This work introduces:

A new open dataset featuring paired 3D ultrasound and CT volumes with accurate liver segmentation annotations.
A model fusion-based registration method that combines deep learning and traditional optimization approaches for robust and accurate results.

Dataset
The dataset includes:
	3D Ultrasound (US) Volumes
	3D Computed Tomography (CT) Volumes
Data Format
	US Data: Provided in NIfTI (.nii) format.
	CT Data: Provided in NIfTI (.nii) format.
